**Data Analysis**

Most of the comments in the sample were about his appearance (38/65), which is likely due to his profession as a model and the fact that the video is about people stereotyping him based on his appearance. Based on the comments related to appearance, it seems like most people accept him as a biracial Nigerian-Korean and find him attractive. There is also a large number of people who think he looks like NCT Lucas.

**Data Collection Parameters**

 Collected a sample of the 33 comments with at least 6 likes and sorted them into the different categories shown above. Comments could fit into multiple categories.

 They are labeled accordingly to match the graph above.

**Data Analysis**

Throughout the video, it seems like the Korean hosts implicitly downplay Hyunmin's experiences and exclude him from the Korean identity. The Korean host speaks English to Hyunmin at 1:27, even though Hyunmin has expressed multiple times before that he cannot speak English. When the hosts talked about Hyunmin's style and stature in response to why Hyunmin feels he earned the title, it demonstrated that they do not grasp the significance of Hyunmin success in getting recognized by TIME magazine and in modeling as a biracial Nigerian-Korean in a society obsessed with pale skin and being "ethnically homogeneous." Additionally, the comparison between Sam, a famous personality in South Korea from Ghana, and Hyunmin was unnecessary and was likely prompted by the fact that they are both of African desecent.

Thus, it shows how biracial individuals in South Korea are subject to prejudices and considered foreigners, regardless of nationality and fluency in Korean due to their appearances.

Most of the comments analyzed in the sample of 33 comments relate to how people are proud of his success (30.8% total). Around half of these comments explicitly stated that they claim him as a Nigerian or African, while in some of the other comments, people were proud of him but wished he learned more about Nigeria. This supports the theory that biracial individuals are more likely to be claimed after achieving success. 17.9% of the comments related to how the Korean hosts seem to still have prejudices against Black or multiracial individuals. Several comments (17.9%) were also about Hyunmin's age, for example how he's successful at such a young age, or that he was assumed to be older. Hyunmin's achievements as a youth is inspiring and is paving the way for other multiracial and Black individuals in Korea and the modeling industry.

These comments demonstrate the impact Hyunmin has on an international-scale as a Korean model who is both biracial and of African descent.
