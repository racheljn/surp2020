Yoon Mi-rae (윤미래), also known as T or Tasha, is Korea's most prominent female rapper. Born in Texas, and raised in South Korea as a biracial African-American Korean, Mi-rae has faced discrimination on both sides.

In the U.S., she was not seen as "Black enough," while in Korea, she was a "Yankee" <sub><sup>([DT MFBTY INTERNATIONAL](https://surp2020.racheljn.vercel.app/sources))</sup></sub>. She did not have friends, was called racial slurs, and eventually dropped out of school at age 15 <sub><sup>([Kim](https://surp2020.racheljn.vercel.app/sources))</sup></sub>.

When she first debuted in the 90s, "hip-hop was like a secret society" and rappers were considered gangsters. She was told to hide her father's African-American background and mask her skin color with light makeup. 

In her song "Black Happiness," she shares her experiences with discrimination growing up and in the industry and proudly claims her heritage. Today, she serves as an ambassador for multicultural youth, and is an advocate against child abuse with her husband Tiger JK.
