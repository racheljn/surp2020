 Due to the subjective nature of interpreting the comments there may be some discrepancy in the data.
 To see examples of comments that fit strictly into one category, [view the excel sheet with extracted comments](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hDQDvAlRN8tfBS0MmrjOAA7nNPxfTUTITiJRdt-6ixM/edit?usp=sharing).
 They are colored accordingly to match the pie chart above.

**Data Analysis**

Most comments were relating to Somi's family (13.5%), how she is as a sister (11.2%), funny moments (12.4%), general support for her (14.6%), and praise relating to her apperance/her being cute (9.0%). Even though the video featured her multiracial family and was emphasizing her English ability, most comments were not about her race nor English. Thus, it appears that Somi has been well-accepted by Korean society and people pay more attention to her interactions with her family and personality, rather than her biracial background.
