Ariana Miyamoto is most well known for claiming the Miss Universe Japan title in 2015. In the Miss Universe pageant she also placed within the top 10. Her dad is African American and her mom is Japanese, and they divorced when she was one. However, she originally never planned to enter a Japanese beauty contest since she felt due to her multiracial origins she would not be able to win. Growing up, Miyamoto attended Japanese public middle school where kids would refuse to touch her because "her color might rub off<sub><sup>([Lies](https://surp2020.racheljn.vercel.app/sources))</sup></sub>". She attended high-school in the US while staying with her dad but could not understand the culture, and realized, ‘Without a doubt, I’m Japanese’<sub><sup>([McNeil](https://surp2020.racheljn.vercel.app/sources))</sup></sub>.

What pushed her to enter this pageant was the suicide of a close biracial friend (half white/half Japanese), who always felt unaccepted by Japanese and was unable to accept himself. She thought “for my friend’s sake, if there was something I could do to change Japan, I should" and entered the contest<sub><sup>([Lies](https://surp2020.racheljn.vercel.app/sources))</sup></sub>.

Her selection set off a firestorm with people saying she didn't look "Japanese" enough to represent Japan, and making other derogatory or hateful comments. Despite the negative comments there were also some supportive ones and some are hopeful about what her win means for Japan's future. Ariana also hopes to push for awareness around discrimination stating, "With more and more international marriages, more children will be born from these marriages, and in this way I hope Japan will become an easier place to live"<sub><sup>([McNeil](https://surp2020.racheljn.vercel.app/sources))</sup></sub>.
