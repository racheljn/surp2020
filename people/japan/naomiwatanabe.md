  Naomi Watanabe is currently one of the most popular public figures in Japan. There she is the most followed celebrity on Instagram, and in 2018 she was one of TIME's "25 Most Influential People on the Internet"<sub><sup>([Hou](https://surp2020.racheljn.vercel.app/sources))</sup></sub>. She is a Japanese comedian (お笑い芸人) who rose to fame due to her celebrity impressions(ものまね) of people like Beyonce and Lady Gaga, receiving nicknames like "The Beyoncé of Japan". She has also acted in musicals and worked as a voice actor. However, she struggled a lot to get to where she is now.

  She was born in Taiwan, and raised in Japan. Her parents divorced and she was primarily raised by her Taiwanese mother who was not fluent in Japanese, resulting in a “double-limited” challenge in which Naomi could speak neither Japanese nor Taiwanese fluently<sub><sup>([Inagaki](https://surp2020.racheljn.vercel.app/sources))</sup></sub>. Despite this Naomi always loved comedians and making people laugh so she attended a training school for comedians in Osaka at age 18<sub><sup>([Inagaki](https://surp2020.racheljn.vercel.app/sources))</sup></sub>.

  At the start of her career due to her lack of fluency in Japanese, she often couldn't express herself properly and began to think becoming a comedian was impossible<sub><sup>(["渡辺直美は台湾"](https://surp2020.racheljn.vercel.app/sources))</sup></sub>. It was only when a more senior comedian gave her advice to capitalize on her talents that she took a 3 month break to study dance and performance in New York, and came back prepared to do the impressions that launched her to fame<sub><sup>(["渡辺直美は台湾"](https://surp2020.racheljn.vercel.app/sources))</sup></sub>. She mentions that growing up she did not face bullying for being Taiwanese but now due to her fame she is sometimes an online target for racism<sub><sup>([Inagaki](https://surp2020.racheljn.vercel.app/sources))</sup></sub>.

  She is also a champion for body positivity, launching her own fashion line called Punyus with clothing of all sizes. She states, "In Japan, there are lots of curvy girls who want to enjoy fashion, but don’t know where to get it or how to get it. I think about those girls. I want to focus on doing a lot, and being inclusive"<sub><sup>([Hou](https://surp2020.racheljn.vercel.app/sources))</sup></sub>.  Her large variety of talents and personality is what makes her so dearly beloved by many and she hopes to spread her message of positivity internationally in the future.
